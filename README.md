# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I will use is the historical performance for each team in NBA league until 2017 seaon. My dataset includes the winning rate for each team in each season. And I need to organize these data, and calcualte the average winning rate for each team in a certain period, like three, five, or ten years. In my project, I will compare the recent winning rate and historical winning rate for each team to show their performance comparison.

## Sketches

In the first iteration, I draw several graphs and finally decide to use this one which is very similar with the first visualization graph. This will be the base sketch of the project.

In he second iteration, I try to add more interaction in the project. I add three filters to pick recent 3, 5, and 10 years performance. And I try to use connected line to show the change on each team, I think this can compare the performance change easier.

## Prototypes to final project 

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. In this visulization, it shows two intersecting axis, which shows the recent winning rate and historical winning rate. This spite the graph into four differnent areas, and each area shows differnent performance. I think that will be clear to observe each team's performance. I will also replace these circles with differnent team's icon.

then I make prototype which include some images in the graph. In this prototype, there is a menu which show several different year's data.

Then I improve this prototye futher more 
This final viz contain all team's data, and users can choose which year's data they want to check.

For another part of my project. that is the line chart for each team and check the genera situation for all team.

Then I transalte this this scater plot to the line chart.

In order to observe all team, I put all team's data into the graph with differnnt colors.

** Future implement 
In the future I want to put the data into the US mapm I have use world map to make some other prototypes with other dataset
