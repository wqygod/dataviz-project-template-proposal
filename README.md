# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I will use is the historical performance for each team in NBA league until 2017 seaon. My dataset includes the winning rate for each team in each season. And I need to organize these data, and calcualte the average winning rate for each team in a certain period, like three, five, or ten years. In my project, I will compare the recent winning rate and historical winning rate for each team to show their performance comparison.

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. In this visulization, it shows two intersecting axis, which shows the recent winning rate and historical winning rate. This spite the graph into four differnent areas, and each area shows differnent performance. I think that will be clear to observe each team's performance. I will also replace these circles with differnent team's icon.

I also hope to implement another function, if users click on the icon of the team, they can view the historical performace for that exactly team, this will shown as a Scatterplot.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
